Created an openCV model that uses eyetacking written in Python to communicate with a microcontroller that will engage a stepper motor which is connected to a spary bottle which will spary the user and keep him awake if the user is following asleep. The main python script will be running and watching the user's eyes to see if they fall asleep and if they do it will send a signal through the script into the microcontroller using I2C and UART commncation protocols to engage the motor and to wake the user up.
